### IMC 490 / IEMS 304, Northwestern University
### Eric Chang

These are the exercises and materials I created while I was a Teaching Assistant for *IMC 490: Machine Learning* in Integrated Marketing Communications. While the section I taught labs for was in IMC, the curriculum nearly identical to *IEMS 304: Data Mining* in Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences and are applicable to both.
